1.What are variables and why are they called variables? Assign two numbers to variables 'a' and 'b' and print their sum.
a=5
b=10
print(a+b)


print("2.Write a python program to substract two numbers and print the result")
num1=123
num2=456
print(num1-num2)


3.Multiply two variables and store the result in a third variable.print all three.
a=432
b=536
c=a*b
print(c)

4.Devide 10 by 3 and print the result with and without decimals.
a=10
b=3
print(a/b)
print(a//b)


5.Use floor division'//' to devide 17 by 4.print the output
a=17
b=4
print(a//b)


6.Use the modulo operator '%' to check the remainder when 25 is devided by 6.
a=25
b=6
print(a%b)
